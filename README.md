# Overview
This application allows users to explore chaos theory through the generation of chaotic attractor-based art. Using mathematical principles, the app creates unique visual representations of chaotic systems, including simple, symmetrical, layered, and gradient-based art.

# How to use:
1. Install the needed libraries: Pillow, Matplotlib, Tkinter, NumPy
2. Run the gui_app.py file:
3. python gui_app.py
4. On the first page, click "Explore" to go to the art generation interface.
5. Choose your desired art type: Simple, Symmetrical, Layered, or Gradient.
6. Customize the color and size settings for simple art.
7. Generate your art and view the resulting image in the window.
